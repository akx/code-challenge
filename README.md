# Motley Code Challenge :rocket:

> A Small repo containing some practical tests

This repository contains some small challenges, usually done by potential new hires during our
recruitment pipeline.

## Getting started

0. Read this README
1. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/motleyagency/code-challenge`)
2. Choose your own adventure
    - [Frontend test](./packages/frontend)
    - [Backend test](./packages/backend)
    - Full-stack developer can do both of them!
3. If you are applying for a job, make your changes, commit them and send them and a small note describing what
  you've done via
    - A link to a public GitHub repo
    - A link to a private GitHub repo where you add @petetnt and @valstu as a collaborator
    - A link to a public / private GitLab/BitBucket repo (or similar)
    - Or by email in an archive that includes the `.git` folder
    to [codechallenge@motley.fi](mailto:codechallenge@motley.fi) or your Motley contact person with a headline "`${YOUR_NAME} - Code challenge`"

## ...or you can contribute to open source projects

If you don't want to do the regular test or want to challenge yourself more, we also appreciate
open source contributions! Send us samples of open source work you have done and descriptions what
you did and why to [codechallenge@motley.fi](mailto:codechallenge@motley.fi) or your Motley contact person and we will continue from there.

If you haven't done open source work before, [`awesome-for-beginners`](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) repo might be a good start.

## Help I am stuck!

Oh no! Send us a message at [codechallenge@motley.fi](mailto:codechallenge@motley.fi) or ping one of us on Twitter
for example [Pete](https://twitter.com/pete_tnt) or [Valtteri](https://twitter.com/valtterikaresto) describing what you've done and what you have tried
and we can try to figure out something together.

## FAQ

#### Can I do these even if I am not applying for a job?

Sure thing! You might even learn something or remember something you've long forgotten!

#### Can I get feedback even if I am not applying for a job?

Probably yes, but no guarantees! We :heart: to help other people, but we are also rather busy so something
might fall through the cracks. It doesn't mean that we don't appreciate your work though!

#### I have an idea that would make these challenges better / I have an idea of completely new one

Awesome! Post them as a issue or send us a mail and we'll look into it!

#### I am not familiar with the tech stack used in here, but I can do it in X/Y/Z

The tests resemble the tech stack that is used most commonly in our projects (React, NodeJS, GraphQL...), but
if you can implement the same thing in some other relevant language or library/framework go for it! We work
with tons of different kinds of stacks all the time from Python to WordPress too.
